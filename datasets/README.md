# Unveiling the potential of GNN for network modeling and optimization in SDN

Datasets can be downloaded from these links:

* NSFNet topology: http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/nsfnet.zip  
  (This dataset was randomly partitioned to obtain the training and evaluation datasets)
* GEANT2 topology: http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/geant2.zip
* GBN topology: http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/GBN.zip  
  (The last two datasets were used only for evaluation)
